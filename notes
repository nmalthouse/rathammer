Be easy and enjoyable to use.
Feature completeness comes after ease of use.

maybe start with an orthographic view with GL_LINES

Large TODO

draw billboarded entity (light, soundscape etc)
how are editor entities defined per game? something about gameinfo.txt

Tools a layer above direct manipulation of solids.
Sketchup esque?

TODO
use the deferred renderer so it looks real pretty
Decide on how editing will be handled
port the cube editor thing from ratgraph and get basic recompute of meshes working.
Render the skybox !

Models
How will models be drawn?
One drawcall per model-material part

Layout of a vtx file:
