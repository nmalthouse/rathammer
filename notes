2d view implementation will require some thought
maybe start with an orthographic view with GL_LINES

Large TODO
support vmt
support models
draw billboarded entity (light, soundscape etc)
how are editor entities defined per game? something about gameinfo.txt

TODO
use the deferred renderer so it looks real pretty
Decide on how editing will be handled
port the cube editor thing from ratgraph and get basic recompute of meshes working.
Render the skybox !
