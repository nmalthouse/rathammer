Notes go here

an interface over vmf parser.
parsing the vmfs into a good structure

Editing operations will modify the underlying csg.
When a brush is edited, the linked mesh is recalculated, takes about 70us per side, not great, not terrible



Graphically,
Start with basic 3d world, noclip movement.

2d view implementation will require some thought

TODO
loading from vpk instead of fs
use the deferred renderer so it looks real pretty
