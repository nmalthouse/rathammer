RatHammer has two selection modes: multi and single.

The mode is toggled with the 'Tab' key.

When the mode is single, pressing E while aiming at an entity (solid, source entity, etc) will make it the current selection.
If the editor option 'ignore groups' is set to false, all entities belonging to the selected entities group will also be added to the selection.

When the mode is multi, pressing E on an entity will or add or remove it from the selection, multiple entities can be selected, regardless of 'ignore groups' setting.

Pressing ctrl+E in either mode will clear the selection.

Most tools support their operations on multi selections if it makes sense to do so.
