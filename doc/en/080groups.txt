Groups

Every entity (brushes, source entities) can belong to one group at a time.

Every group can be owned by one entity at a time.

For export to Source engine games, groups only serve the purpose of indicating which brushes form a brush entity.

Groups are created by pressing ctrl+t, all selected entities will be grouped. 
If entities already belong to a group, the entities are merged into the group of the last entity selected. If the last entity is not in a group a new group is created.
