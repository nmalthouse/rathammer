Notes on asset loading and path mangling.

Official Valve tools seem to be case insensitive when it comes to asset names.

Any resource paths specified in vmf's, vmt's, and mdl's are lowercased and backslashes are converted to forward slashes.
Any resource paths in rathammer .json maps are case sensitive.

This means that if you have a vmt file in a loose directory which specifies a vtf "MyVtf.vtf", rathammer will search for 
a file named myvtf.vtf and thus not find it.

In short, if you are having trouble with loose content not getting found, lowercase all of it and remove any '\' characters.

If you have a file named MyCoolTexture.png, rathammer will write MyCoolTexture.png to the map.json and everything will work!
