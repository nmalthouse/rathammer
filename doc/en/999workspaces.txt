Workspaces. 

Traditional GUI's typically create many smaller pop-up windows for modifying objects.

RatHammer uses a system of workspaces and panes.
Some panes include the:
    Main 3d editor view
    Inspector Panel
    Texture browser
    Model browser
    Model preview

Each workspace contains some number of panes and panes can be present in more than one workspace.
