Exporting.

RatHammer saves maps to a json file. There are a few ways to export the map to vbsp for compilation.
The command line tool jsonmaptovmf --json mymap.json will export a vmf file.

The command line tool mapbuilder --vmf dump.vmf launch vbsp, vvis, and vrad using wine and then copy the built bsp to the games map folder.

Pressing F9 in the editor will export the map and attempt to build it with mapbuilder
