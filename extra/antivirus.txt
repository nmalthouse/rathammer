On Windows, rathammer.exe and/or mapbuilder.exe are sometimes flagged as virus's.

On my system (Windows 10), it labeled rathammer as a PUA and mapbuilder as something really dangerous or something. (The learn more linked to nothing)

Whitelist rathammer by going to windows defender, finding the threat, and selecting "restore".

Rathammer and mapbuilder both create child process, (vbsp, vvis, vrad), to compile your map, which is probably part of why they get flagged.

If you do not trust that the software is safe, you are free to audit the source code at:
https://github.com/nmalthouse/rathammer

and build it from source yourself.
