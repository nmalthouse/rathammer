IF you did not download rathammer from "https://github.com/nmalthouse/rathammer" then I can not guarantee the security of it.

On Windows, rathammer.exe are sometimes flagged as virus's by Windows Defender and moved to quarantine.

IF Rathammer "crashes" while loading/saving AND you get a Windows defender notification, Defender probably killed one of the loading threads.

Rathammer uses a thread pool to load assets and do other jobs. For example, when you press ctrl+s to save, Rathammer creates a thread which does the actual compression and writing of the map to disk. IF Windows decides this thread is a "trojan" for whatever reason, rathammer will crash and your map will not have been saved. Sorry, but there is nothing I can do about this short of paying Microsoft to shut up.

IF Defender quarantines any of the exe's:
White-list rathammer by going to Windows Defender, finding the threat, and selecting "restore".

Rathammer does a number of things which look suspicious to an AV, these include:
* Creating child process, (vbsp, vvis, vrad), to compile your map.
* Creating a socket file for the console/remote control functionality
* Sending a network request on startup to check for newer versions 

If you do not trust that the software is safe, you are free to audit the source code at:
https://github.com/nmalthouse/rathammer

And build it from source yourself.


The files you may want to look at include:
* src/map_builder.zig               # spawns child processs
* src/rpc/server.zig                # creates a socket file
* src/async.zig CheckVersionHttp    # Sends a single http GET request on startup to a hard-coded URL: "http://nmalthouse.net:80/api/version"
